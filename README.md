## Description

**CatChatter** is a web application that allows users to track and update information about their cats. Users can create profiles for each of their cats, and share photos, all while connecting with other cat owners.

### Background Information

The idea for this app originated from my love for cats and the need for a platform where cat owners can easily share updates about their feline friends. CatChatter aims to bring together a community of cat lovers who want to stay connected and informed about their cats' lives.
